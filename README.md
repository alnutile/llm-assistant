### About

"LLMAssistant" or "LLMass.io" for now (Still working on the name ðŸ˜„).

This tool is like your personal assistant, helping you stay organized, market your services, and even create content. 
Imagine a tool that collects interesting articles for you, gives you a TL;DR, and even helps you write job posting replies.
It's powered by OpenAI, which means it can perform various functions like scheduling tasks and summarizing your day. 
It's like having a bullet journal that writes itself.
Stay tuned for more updates on this game-changer. 
And hey, I'm all ears for any feedback or suggestions you might have!

### Install and Setup

This is a just a normal Laravel Application. It will need Sail just for the Postgres embedding feature.


### Schedule Email box checker

Just update the `.env` and make sure you have scheduling setup for every minute and send away

If the email has a url it will get the results

```dotenv
