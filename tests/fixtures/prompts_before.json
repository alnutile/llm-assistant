It is designed to simplify complex data filtering and sorting logic for eloquent queries. By adding the \"filter()\" method to your Eloquent query, you can easily add the ability for frontend users to apply filters based on URL query string parameters.\n\nSome features of \"laravel-purity\" include:\n\n- Developer-friendly and front-end developer-friendly\n- Frontend developers can use filtering and sorting of the APIs by using the popular JavaScript qs package\n- Inspired by strapi's filter and sort functionality\n\nTo use \"laravel-purity\", you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the package using Composer:\n   ```\n   composer require abbasudo\/laravel-purity\n   ```\n\n2. Get the configuration file (configs\/purity.php) to customize the package's behavior:\n   ```\n   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=purity\n   ```\n\n3. Add the `Filterable` trait to your model to get filter functionalities:\n   ```php\n   use Abbasudo\\Purity\\Traits\\Filterable;\n\n   class Post extends Model\n   {\n       use Filterable;\n       \/\/ ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Add the `filter()` method to your model's Eloquent query in the controller:\n   ```php\n   use App\\Models\\Post;\n\n   class PostController extends Controller\n   {\n       public function index()\n       {\n           return Post::filter()->get();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\nYou can also add the `Sortable` trait to your model to get sort functionalities. The package allows you to restrict filters in different ways, such as passing filters as an array to the `filter()` function, declaring filters in the model, or specifying filters in the configuration file.\n\nThe package also provides examples of how to use the filters and sorting in JavaScript with the qs package.\n\nFor more information and advanced usage of \"laravel-purity\", you can visit the GitHub repository: [abbasudo\/laravel-purity](https:\/\/github.com\/abbasudo\/laravel-purity).\n###END_CONTENT",
